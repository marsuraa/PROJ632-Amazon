Therefore; I opted for this which is scaled down in terms of processing/memory BUT it's much better quality than the phone I was using for my Boost Mobile account. I had no issues charging it or switching it over from old phone to this new phone - via my online account (I didn't have to talk to anybody to do this and it worked out just great). My hubby has the Samsung S6 which he saved/paid for upfront (no contract at Boost Mobile). Comparing my new J7 to his S6 - well; apples to oranges. His has 2 processors (a quad-core and an octa-core). This J7 has just the octa-core BUT for me is proving to be plenty of processing power along with the 2GB ROM. This was pretty comparable to the ZTE Warp Elite I've been using since January 2016 but I'd have to say that the Samsung is much faster - also that the screen response is so much better in this J7 model (even with the glass protection I placed on the screen). My hubby bought me this for my upcoming 60th birthday! GREAT present for me.....all mine! Thank you 'shopcelldeals' for selling this at a reasonable price that was affordable. Recommended.",

Usually I buy cheaper phones - ZTE, Huawei, etc. Fed up with the limited memory and laggy performance of those cheap phones, I splurged a bit and bought this Galaxy 7. I'm very glad I did! Calls are clear, the operating system is reasonably quick and snappy and I have yet to run out of memory (I do have a 32gb sd card installed in the phone to help with that). The case is white plastic and, while cheap, feels solid. the screen is bright and clear. I'm a photographer, and find that the camera takes very good photos - not as good as a dslr camera, but very good for a budget smartphone. A few issues I do have are fairly small. The media audio could be better. The sound coming from its small (and only) rear speaker is pretty minimal. Also, colors on the screen seem to be somewhat over-saturated. Supposedly on other Samsung models, there is a way to change this, but I haven't been able to do so on this phone. OVerall, a very good choice for a budget smartphone",

I think it's may not be because of this device, but because of the it's company's service. Camera and picture quality will surprise you, specially under daylight and it's very fair indoors. The size is decent and fits as expect in a medium hand size like mine. Battery is ok, you should expect to charge your phone more often according to the size of it's screen and your daily usage of apps, etc. 2 charges per day is my reality right now. It comes with a blank simcard and the activation can be done online or on the phone. It's a cake if you follow instructions on the box correctly. I gave 4 stars because this is the 2nd device I get from this seller the first came and looked perfect, but sttoped working in less than a month. Thankfully Amazon allows us to return and I chose to give a try and get another phone. It's working ok so far. I recommend the phone, if you don't have too high standards this phone will be what are you looking for and with a decent price. This is my honest opinion. I bought this on my own, no discounts or gifts were given.",

For instance, I place all the apps that I can on the sd card, but periodically they switch back the the internal storage versus the external storage. How bizarre is that? Also, for the last week I have attempted to make phone calls and the line rings and rings and rings, but I can call the same phone number from my house and even if no one answers, I can at least get their voice mail. At that point, I have to turn my phone off and back on again in order to make calls. During that time though, I can still send and receive tests, Facebook messages as well as email. These issues wouldn't bother me too much if the phone was older. Not only did I order this phone, but I order another more generic type of phone with the same operating system for my spouse and it works just fine.",

First of all although Warp Elite was a fast phone this phone in terms of app use, internet, os, seems faster. Also for some reason i have never been able to use my hotspot feature (it always says you must contact provider and be charged more) but right off the bat the J7 allowed me to use my one as a hotspot. Screen is a beautiful oled and battery is removable and lasts long. My only issue with the phone is the rear camera. It says its 13 mp just like the Warp Elite but my Warp took better pictures. The pictures on rear camera come out fuzzy (and no the plastic isnt in the lens). Idk maybe i need to tweak it more but auto zoom is an issue. Front camera seems way clearer to me. Overall a freat phone and i love it!",

It was for boost mobile, which I already have...(which is one reason I bought it). My husband saw it and wanted it. Sadly, he waited to long and the deal was done by Sunday. He ended up finding it on here for 140$.. I honestly didn't realize how big this phone is. I love it. My old phone was a lg volt...it's tiny compared to this phone. Samsung is definitely a great brand. Pros: Responsive... My old phone took ages to load apps, and sometimes the browser would go slow. So far this phone is fast... only app it seems to lag with is messenger..but I think it's the apps fault. Camera is amazing. Good amount of space. Games work well..the only one my phone got warm with was angry birds 2...(which doesn't live up to the first... and I'll probably delete if it doesn't get harder).. Cons: So far the battery is my only concern. It is a giant one..but seems to drain fast. I ended up putting my background darker and that seems to help my battery. Transferring was easy because I had the same company. No new number and I didn't have to pay any extra. My husband was with virgin mobile. He had a harder time activating it...He ended up getting a new number. It kept saying they couldn't transfer the number. But he's just as happy with it and is trying to get use to the size. His old phone is a Kyocera hydro vibe (which was a fine phone).. he had since mid 2014. And it was having issues charging. His only concern is that phone was water proof.. which was great for him(because his job). He hasn't had any issues with his.. I haven't had issues with my either.",

My husband ended up liking it enough that he bought himself one to also replace his GS3. The things I didn't like about it he was alright dealing with. My 2 big complaints with it were 1) There were NO NOTIFICATION LIGHTS! This was a pretty big problem for me, if this was the only problem, I could have probably learned to not rely on the lights so much but that was a no go for me personally. 2) I couldn't move my downloaded apps onto my memory card as I've always done. I don't download too many apps but I tried everything I could think of to move the apps (I worked specifically with cell phones for nearly 3 years so I knew what I was doing) Other than those things, I really liked the size and it seemed to run very smoothly but for me somethings just can't be accepted when it comes to my phone (I also won't buy a phone that you can't add expandable memory to or take the battery out of). Those are just my preferences but I overall LOVE the Samsung Galaxy Series on what I've had.",

On the plus side the octacore processor is lightning fast, and the battery seems to outlast my note 4. My only 2 complaints is that the keys at the bottom are not backlit, and that there is no ambiant light sensor, so you cant use auto backlight adjustment. The build quality feels nice, not as good as the top models, but dosent feel like china made junk. Overall im extremely pleased with this phone.",

Its about the same size as the stylo but its thinner and so much lighter. The camera, front and back, takes some awesome pictures. The price was extremely better than the boostmobile site, the site had this phone on sale for 199.99 and amazon had it on sale for 169.99. I highly recommend this phone if you wanna upgrade , but dont wanna come extremely outta pocket... only problem i have is trying to order a case online, most cases are for the 2015 version and not this 2016 version... otherwise awesome phone!!",

I have to just periodically call my voicemail and boost isn't compatible with third party voicemail apps from the play store. Other than that, i love the phone. The camera and camcorder are good quality. It doesn't like to auto focus very well and i often have to tap the screen where it needs to focus, but that's not a big deal. I love the native flashlight app so that i don't have to clutter my phone with a flashlight app from the playstore. I love the front flash. It has come in very handy both for selfies and when I've had to use my camera as a makeup mirror. It has a very decent size internal memory. I thought it came with fm radio and was a little disappointed to find that it didn't. I also like the built in themes (I'm not sure if that's because of the phone itself or the marshmallow os. I upgraded from a galaxy prevail lte running kit kat os) and the phone's capability to do a couple things that have required root on previous devices. It's a pretty study and well built phone. I've dropped it a couple times before i got my case and there is very little damage. The phone is an excellent bargain. It's well worth what i paid and then some. I only rated 4 stars because of the complete lack of native voicemail app and inability to use any third party voicemail apps.",

It doesn't matter what wi-fi I'm on, it is slow. I can't use my phone in the next room of my home. Data speed is incredibly slow. Geekbench score is 512/1405. We're talking 2.5-3 G speeds. I drop calls constantly. Can't get Android Device Manager to work. I*need* Android device manager Ghosts network.I have disconnected from Xfiniti numerous times a day. It kicks me off my albeit weak wi-fi and tries to sign me in to something I don't have. I have to watch it constantly to make sure I am on my wi-fi. Made the mistake of thinking the phone would stay connected (silly me) and my data use went through the roof. Now I have to be constantly vigilant about it. It takes forever to charge, and it drains quickly. GPS constantly has a problem finding me rendering the Maps app practically useless. I have to download directions before I leave the house because I never know is it will work. This is just some of the issues I have. I hate this phone with every fiber of my being. I came from a 30.00 Moto E, and as bad as that phone was, it is leaps and bounds better than this one. I've had the phone since August. I was really hoping I would get used to it, or it would improve. No such luck.",

But I won't kid you into thinking there is little difference between this unit and one costing hundreds more, there are big differences. The screen resolution is more dull and the colors less crisp/vibrant than say a Galaxy S7 or any iphone. I have had to contend with a very annoying issue where the person I'm talking with suddenly cannot hear me, but that happens only when I using a headset, still it should never happen. The OS does get a bit laggy at times but it is also recommended to restart the phone periodically, which I do once or twice a week and then the performance improves dramatically. You should also clear out your cached data files as well. But overall I am quite happy with this phone. Generally it performs well when it comes to speed, video display, battery life (actually much more impressive than I expected), and I do have to say the cameras are excellent. Very sharp video and photos. Sound is rich and clear. For my purposes this phone does very well. If you need a decent and (mostly) reliable smartphone on a budget I would recommend the J7. UPDATE: This phone is dead. Simply stopped charging for reasons unknown, battery is OK, charging port undamaged. It was never dropped or exposed to water, it just simply died. Guy at the Boost store said the phone is one of the worst they sold and have discontinued it. Several similar problems reported with the J7. It was only two months old. DO NOT BUY!!",

First of all...the display is gorgeous and crisp...sound on media, videos, and calls is great...and this phone is super fast...so... I'm in love lol...however...please don't buy this phone, expecting it to be equivalent to an S7...it is not...blatantly you get what you pay for...samsung cut corners on this phone such as there is no notification light flash...and the screen resolution is not comparable to a higher end phone, so it comes down to common sense as far as what you get with a $150 phone vs a $800 phone. If you're looking for an updated phone (this one runs on marshmellow..which is wonderful), thats larger in size (this phone is bigger than the S7)...without paying several hundred dollars...this j7 is a great start. Definitely recommend this product. Phone also came quickly and brand new in box.",

So naturally, I took the leap of pure excitement and joy to own this phone. Wow, I wish I hadn't. For starters, the battery life is horrendous. I got maybe 8-9 hours of battery life with low usage and 5-6 with higher usage. The phone continuously got pretty hot to the touch, even with a phone case. I gave one star because I enjoyed the display on the AMOLED screen. That was the only single thing I enjoyed on this phone. The phone itself wasn't user friendly like I've known ZTE and LG phones to be. There is no notification lights to let you know if you have messages, emails, missed calls or if your phone is charging. I swapped this phone after 8 days for the ZTE Max XL and what a beautiful difference. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone in my opinion.",

                "review_text": "UPDATE: 8 AUGUST 2016 I ended up returning this phone to Best Buy and buying the Honor 5X unlocked smartphone, 16GB Dark Grey (US Warranty) . Why? Well, the battery capacity is larger. I not a power user, but that means I don't have to charge my phone at 3 pm! Second, this phone has a fingerprint reader. I can't tell you how much better it is to use your finger vs. a 4-digit pin code or some random pattern I'll probably forget. Like the J7, it only has 16 GB, which means you only have about 10-12 GB when you get the phone, but this phone is my \"interim\" phone - so I don't mind. I also like the \"brushed\" dark grey metallic looking form on the Honor 5X. ***************************************************************************************************************************** For a prepaid phone, it's not bad. I like that it's slim and at 5.5\" it's not too big/not too small. Camera is okay, but for better pictures download the Open Camera app from Google Play. The battery is decent at 3,000 maH, so if you're not a heavy user, that's enough. Heavy users will be disappointed. Screen collects finger prints, so invest in a screen protector that's fingerprint resistant. Service at work is great, but just down the street where I live, I only see about 2 or 3 bars. Depends on where I \"point\" my phone. It's really weird. On a final note, I paid $129.99 and quite frankly, would never pay more for this phone. If you want to spend more money, buy the Moto G or Moto G Plus (the 4th Generation models).",

                "review_text": "I love this Samsung J7, since it is bigger than the s6 and s7, and as good as my old S5 (as compared in the images). I had no issues charging it or switching it over from old phone to this new phone - via a 4 minute phone call to Boostmobile. Yes, the S6 and S7 have -much- faster processors, but I do not need that for what I do... and so far, after 1 month of use, I absolutely love this phone!. The phone feels great, responds quickly, and looks freaking awesome. Pros: -Great price -AFFORDABLE! -Bigger than most other phones available -Great quality screen Cons: -2 bottom buttons- on side of the main home button- DO NOT light up -Camera is not comparable to that of the S5, S6, and S7 -Overall quality does not feel as sturdy as the other models mentioned (Shell plastic is thinner). After one month of use, I rated this phone with 4 stars. I will be updating this review in about 6 months. REVIEW UPDATE: February 19, 2017 After eight (8) months of owning this phone, and 7 months since this original review, I am back today to continue my review as promised. I am doing 2 things for those of you who are reading this review for the first time: 1) I have added a star to make this a 5 star review! 2) I will explain why I have decided to come back to add this star to my review. Let me clarify that since reviewing this, I have purchased a second one for my wife. I will also list what items I purchased it along with: Mr Shield Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy J7 [Will Not Fit For 2016 Version] - 2-Pack Samsung EVO 64GB Micro SDXC Memory Card with Adapter up to 48/MB/s (MB-MP64DA/AM) Phonelicious SAMSUNG Galaxy J7 Case(Boost,Virgin,TMobile,Metro PCS)Slim Fit Heavy Duty Ultimate Drop Protection Rugged Cover with Screen Protector & Stylus (Navy Blue Matte) Of course, purchasing a case, the Screen protector, and a good quality memory card may also influence how this product has performed. This phone continues to work as expected, and has delivered so far. I feel my investment on this phone has paid off, and my money has been worth. Being a somewhat frugal shopper, I thought I would give this phone a try to since it's price was reasonable for what I was getting. My 1 year old (who is now 18 months) has used and abused this phone. He has thrown it on the floor dozens of times, and has scratched, as well chewed on it. What has happened to the phone so far? - It has gained a large crack, on the screen protector. The phone is still working as it did 8 months ago, and the cheap items I purchased to protected have taken quite the toll. I had originally mentioned that the phone felt \"cheap\", and the thin plastic that it is made out of, is certainly noticeable compared to the quality of the S5, and other S series for that matter. Given that this phone has performed well, continues to deliver, and has outlasted quite some abuse, I made the judgement to give this phone the extra star, since this is a great product to my standards. I plan to come back in June, and review this item again after a full year of use!",

                "review_text": "Probably the best phone I've ever had. I've had it for about 3 months with no issues whatsoever. I have downloaded a bunch of apps and storage has not been an issue at all, which has always been a problem for me with much fewer apps than I have now. Works great and always fast. The ONLY thing I don't like about it is the screen is huge in my little hands, but I knew that after having read the specs before I bought the phone. Never had a problem with sound from either the speakers or headphones. Has never frozen or restarted without my initiation. I love the headphones it came with, also. Although I do not like the style of the small earbuds, I love having the controls on the cord. I has pause and volume controls, with a mic (which I have never used). The pause only doesn't work intermittently when I want it to start back up again, usually when it's been paused for at least several minutes; the volume button only doesn't work if you're going to turn it up past the recommended volume for hearing damage, but that doesn't happen often, so I think I've figured out it keeps my preference setting until I do a reboot on my phone. I don't think that, while sometimes I don't feel or hear it, that it's ever failed to bring up notifications of messages or phone calls. So... PROS *Price *Sound *Speed *Storage space *Camera quality (let's face it, you're not taking professional pics with your phone, still the best phone camera I've ever had) *Customization CONS *Pretty darn large, especially with a case on it. *It has been really hard to get used to having a home button I actually have to depress instead of simple touch.",

This 2015 version performs about 30% better than the 2016 version, but has worse reception, so there is a tradeoff. Camera quality is a little low for the size of the photos it takes, which is disappointing, but it beats spending $1,000 on a leading edge device. The internal memory taken up by boost mobile / required bloatware uses almost 50% of it's capacity. Using the built in optimzation tool, at rest with no apps the phone also uses 1.2 GB of its 2GB of RAM, a very large chunk of this phone's resources are spent just turning it on, which is disappointing. I recently got it wet, to the point where the phone rebooted due to error - I quickly pulled the battery and let it dry in the sun for 2 days. It still works perfectly. Overall, a good phone for the price, and much better than the J7 Perx, don't be fooled by marketing.",

I deleted that app & downloaded one thru Outlook which works perfectly. I thought the battery would hold a charge better than it does. I've had to charge it up before the end of the day. Those are my only 2 gripes so far. It is much bigger that my S3 which I didn't realize the difference would be that much, but I will get used to it.

I typically get home with 30-40% remaining with casual browsing and periodic use. It never hiccups or has any software issues... just keeps going and going. No plans on upgrading anytime soon. My wife now has a new'ish iPhone 6, and nothing on that phone is better than this one... and her battery has never lasted here an entire day, even brand new. ORIGINAL REVIEW: This phone is an incredible bargain. In 8 months of ownership, it never makes me wait for anything and has been rock solid... no funny glitches or flickers or nonsense. The battery still lasts me all day with casual use of just calls and texting and occasional web-browsing at lunch or whatever. If I had to roughly guess, the battery last me about 4 times longer than my wifes Iphone5 that cost her $500. I have never had any memory or storage problems and am using a Samsung class10 32gb microSD card. I can stream music and use any app simultaneously, and the few games I have run on their highest settings with no trouble. I have a generic $10 cover and some off-brand Gorilla-glass protector and have nothing but awesome things to say about this phone. OH YEAH, the camera is outstanding... put any iphone camera (including the iphone6) to shame. Great low-light and color. I regularly print family photos taken on this phone and they are fantastic. The flash LED also makes a great flashlight and the speaker is plenty loud. All in all, this is the best phone I've ever owned, and not just for the money, the best phone period. My wife has always had iphones, and this thing is better than all of them. -Sam",

The camera also works quite well with the exception that focusing on it can be frustrating at times. Newest version of android also makes the phone nice and snappy. Of course, more expensive phones blow this one out of the water, but for the price this one is fantastic. Overall a great buy for anyone wanting a mid price phone that is reliable.",

At least I now have functional GPS! Physically, the phone is on the large side for some reason which probably makes it seem dated. I believe it is larger than the S7. In order to make this phone as affordable as it is some corners had to be cut. The build quality is pretty heavy on the plastic side. The back panel is about as thin as you can make a piece of plastic. The screen resolution is not at the same level as the S7 because of less pixel density but it still looks good. Processing power is light but adequate for my purposes. If you're a gamer you should probably look elsewhere. Storage is also on the light side but is plenty for me though it would have been nice to have less bloatware. People will need to have a little discipline with the storage. I think most people just download useless Playstore software, forget about it and then wonder why their phone is out of space. Anyway, I was already on Boost Mobile so the update and transition to this phone was super easy. Phone was essentially ready in 20 minutes though an Android security update was required a little later. Now speeding along running Marshmallow 6.0.1. Happy camper so far with the only pet peeve being that there is no flashing LED indicator for messages, missed calls, or anything! I'm not sure why that would be left out since I thought it was pretty much standard issue on all phones. It's not a deal breaker but if you're a message freak it could be a problem. All said, you really can't beat the performance for the price!!",

But other than that I have no cons. Better Ops, better storage, Rams. I don't have the desire to throw this phone off a bridge.. which is great!! Also it didnt cost $700. Which I wouldnt have ever paid for any electronic. The $170 was just right. An cheaper then the boost mobile.com/ in store...",

First, the battery (for my use) lasts about 3.5 days before requiring a re-charge. I'm in 7th heaven for just this feature. I had to install 'so-called' battery saving app's for my other 3 android phones that never really performed sufficiently. I don't need to add an app for the J7. All the app's that came standard with the phone (plus a few that I use for finding cheap gas, staying abreast of news and weather, and keeping records of fuel and mileage use) are all I need. I didn't use the camera feature on the other phones because of difficulty in use. The J7 camera is easy and I've been using it more than my digital camera.

Pros Outside mode for extra brightness, very helpful. Fast processor (probably not as awesome as a S7 but for $400 or so less..., 3 times as expensive does not seem worth it because that difference in money is going to allow me to build a htpc, kinda crazy the amount of money but i digress) use in mexico, actually why chose this phone over the ZTE Warp Elite which has very similar specs and is currently $100 less but from a much less reputable (quality, security (national and personal)) company. Does everything i want it to. Main improvements to phone over the my last phone is how the OS works and allows you to things like answer text messages without leaving the app you are already using. Cons I dont like the headphones. this may be a personal thing because my main issue is the fit, i tried all the different soft ear pieces and still can't keep them in my ear.",

The apps that are already pre installed are great as well, there are many new things to explore. I know the phone is brand new, but for now, the battery life is fantastic even with my frequent usage for videos and social media. Would highly recommend to someone looking for a new \"trendy\" boost phone who doesn't want to go the months worth of rent route for a phone. Also, after tax even, this phone is $30 cheaper here from this seller than any retailer I looked at.",

I'm excited about being able to play my games again now that I can actually download apps with out running out of disk space. I had the galaxy prevail a couple years ago and I loved it, it's my kids phone now. So I figure this one won't suck. I don't like the size. This phone is huge in my opinion although it is very slim, which helps I guess. But it will definitely take some getting used too. I like these phones a lot. It's nice to have the nice galaxy look and overall great functionality, without all of the fancy stuff that makes the S series cost more than my rent. This is a great alternative to the more expensive models, especially if you don't need all of the extra fancy things those other phones do, like finger print locking and whatnot.",

Tips, use Smart Manager, found in settings, to clear memory every couple of days. Get the Open Camera app for camera functions, your photos will be much better than the one that comes with the phone. There seems to be some concern whether it's a 2015, or 2016 model, well it's a little of both. Made in 2016 with some upgrades from 2015, but not full blown like those for some other carriers. The case is still plastic, not metal, and the back speaker/flash locations didn't change. The cpu is a tad slower, and the battery is 3000mAh not 3300. I think the Boost Mobile version is a hybrid of the two. I bought a case for the 2015 model and it fits fine, YMMV There isn't a led notification light, but there is an audio one and apps are available to flash the camera's flash for incoming texts. A setting on the phone for hearing impaired is suppose to do this, but it didn't work for me. The camera is a bit finicky and over saturates somewhat. There must be a coating on the display, it resists fingerprints and smudges. Use a totally black wallpaper to save a bit on power usage. I'm a senior citizen and upgraded from the LG Volt, and could not be happier with my decision.",

Found them on the Samsung website in the Q and A forum, so thought I would share them with other's who really want the LED notification. Hope it helps! Good luck. Solution #1 Go to settings; click accessibility > hearing > then turn on Flash Notification and that's it. Your rear camera flash will blink whenever you receive a call or message. Solution #2 Or... download LED Blinker Pro from the Google Play Store. This app lets you set notification lights to appear at the bottom of your screen (or at a position of your choice) for texts, calls, etc.",

                "review_text": "This phone is a phablet, unfortunately--I'm not crazy about the bulky size but the more appealing (in terms of size and looks) J3 was too underpowered for me, so a phablet it is. The memory and processor speed are adequate for non-power users--everything I use fit on the phone no problem with lots of space to spare. I have experienced no lags so far with apps opening or using multiple apps at the same time. I'm used to turning the wi-fi, data, and GPS on and off when I need them. Letting the phone determine what should be on in the background based on what app is being used is a strange experience for me. However, Marshmallow does a much smoother job with this than in the Jellybean and Kit Kat days. With older phones I used top get annoying pop-up messages every time I passed a McDonald's, Starbucks or anyplace with wi-fi strong enough to be detected from the street asking me if I wanted to sign in. When driving these constant pop ups would be annoying beyond belief, which was why I got into the habit of turning everything on or off myself depending on my needs. Marshmallow seems to do a good job of doing this on its own. I have noticed no battery drain as a result of allowing Android to manage the services in the background. Battery charges quickly and battery life improves after a few days. This is at least partly because of a feature that sends apps that haven't been used in three days into power saving mode. Pro: extended battery life. Con: the app in battery saving mode might not be able to send notifications, but if it isn't an app you use every day you probably don't need notifications from it anyway. One of the most annoying things about this phone is that there is no ambient light sensor--if you don't like the brightness you need to use a slider and change it manually. I haven't had a phone without an ambient light sensor in years and I miss the feature--although the screen is bright enough outdoors that I haven't needed to use outdoors mode yet. Some people don't seem to care about this but for a two hundred dollar phone, it's a pretty basic feature to leave out. I'm not a fan of Samsung's Touch Wiz interface and wish phone manufacturers would stop trying to improve Android by laying their own interface on top of it. You can get rid of some of Touch Wiz (if you don't like it) by replacing the launcher, but the available menu options still seem more Samsung than Android to me and took me a short while to get used to. If you are on a budget and use a carrier like Boost or Virgin Mobile with no sim card then more powerful, cheaper Chinese phones aren't really an option. This is a pretty good choice if the phablet thing isn't a deal breaker. It provides adequate power, pretty good call quality, charges quickly and has good battery life. Not bad for a two hundred dollar phone but if you are used to a better quality Galaxy this will definitely feel like a budget phone. I preferred my Galaxy S3, but nothing lasts forever.",
